            <img src="assets/images/avatar.jpg" alt="Developer's Avatar" />
            <p>Ny name is Samantha Shuttleworth and I am studying to become a Full Stack Web Developer. Deciding to pursue this field definitely made me nervous, because I have no previous experience in the coding world. My preevious job was a service writer for a local mechanic shop. I learned a lot about vehicle maintenance and how a mechanic shop runs. I created great relationships with my customers and formed wonderful relationships with the mechanics. Before I worked at the mechanic shop, I worked at Geico's National Print Mail Center as a Document Specialist. It was a labor intensive job, where I was on my feet for thirteen hours a day. I worked on mail inserting machiens as well as enormouse printers that were responsible for printing all customer paperwork. I enjoyed both jobs, but I knew it was time for a change. In December of 2023, I decided to take the chance and enroll in a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  It has been a very challenging, but rewarding journey. Even thought the bootcamp is coming to an end, I will continue to code and learn all that I can. My goal is to make a career out of my skills and I look forward to what the future will hold for me in this field. </p>
