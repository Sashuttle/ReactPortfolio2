# reactportfolio2
Challenge 20 is a fully functioning React Application Portfolio. It will display a section about myself, a link that will take the user to my portfolio section with live links to the deployed projects and their related respositories.  The contact page will have a form that will allow the user to contact me.  Finall there is the resume page that should allow the user to download a copy of my resume and that page will also list what im proficient in.  At the bottom of the page are little icons for my Github, linkedin, and stack overflow accounts.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the resources that have been available for me to be able to accomplish this project.  This includes class recordings, class lessons, chat gpt, and xpert learning assistant. These tools helped me with being able to build and deploy my personal react portfolio.  I would also like to acknowledge Pedro Tech on youtube.  I was very confused even when asking the chat ai's.  Watching the beginning of his video tutorial helped clear up a lot of confusion I had for this project.
